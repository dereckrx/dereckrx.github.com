## So you want to buy a bike?

First check out this [guide] and their [tools] that give you a result like [this].

I'm 5'7" so my frame sizes are: 

* Road Bike: 55cm / 22 inches
* Mountain Bike: is 46 cm / 18 inches

I ended up going with a 56cm Road frame after trying out the different sizes.

> A quick way to check the frame size is to stand over the frame with both feet on the ground. If you have an inch or so between the frame of a racing, touring or hybrid bike and your crotch it should be about right. For a mountain bike the distance to the frame should be greater.

## What do you want? 

You don't need to decide all of these right now, but it will get you started in the right direction. 

* General Style: Mountain, Road, Hybrid or Urban/Commuter style
* What frame size do you need? 
* Brakes: Pads or disk
* How many speeds do you want? Single or multiple (3 - 29)
* Handlebar Style: Straight, Curved, raised.
* Tire Style: skinny, fat
* Brand, Colors and bells and whistles 

### Good Brands

From my research, Trek and Cannondale seemed to be on top when it comes to quality and style. I considered the [Trek District][], [Cannondale Bad Boy][], and [Giant Seek][] when I was looking for an all black bike. But I also liked the look and feel of the [Felt Brougham][], even though it was a single speed.

### Cool bike technology
* Belt drive: uses a belt instead of a chain in the drive shaft. No grease :)
* Chainless: uses a shaft instead of a chain, just like a car. 
* Internal Hub: allows shifting without gears or a de-railer. Looks like a single speed. 

## Shopping
[Craigslist Bikes] and then use [CraigsEasy] to just show all the pictures.

### Test riding bikes
* Bring a form of ID or possibly credit card as collateral
* Check breaks, tire pressure, and frame frame height
* Adjust seat
* Bring own helmet if possible
* Take it for a twenty minute ride if you can, try out different terrain to test all the features and shifters. Try out hills, bumps, gravel.
* A really great bike can also give you a bit of a buzz, a completely subjective emotional quality that puts it above another for no real reason
